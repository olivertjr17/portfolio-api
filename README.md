# 🌐 Portfolio API (Laravel Backend)

This is the **backend API** for my personal portfolio website.  
It’s built with **Laravel**, powered by **Laravel Breeze** and **Sanctum** for authentication and security.  
The API provides dynamic project management — allowing new portfolio projects to be added or updated easily without redeploying the frontend.
